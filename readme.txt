== Description ==
It doesn't matter how much traffic you are getting to your niche website; you won't make a good amount until you are getting a good conversion rate.
As a niche website builder, I know this brutal truth. 

While working on my site, I had to find some ways that can increase my overall conversion rate from niche website (visitor click to Amazon affiliate links).

During my research, I found visitors click more on image based / graphical call to action, so I developed my own plugin to implement this technique to my niche website.

= Features =

AzonBox is developed for all Amazon affiliate marketers to increase the conversion rate. 

This simple plugin will allow you to add 3 types of call to action box with multiple images.
AzonBox comes with 3 basic layout of call to action by default, and more on its' way.

During my initial test with a niche website, this plugin increased `20%` conversion rate.
